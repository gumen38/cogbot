Hello CoG, I was playing as dedicated player for 10 month from Oct 2011 to Jun 2012.

I've returned recently in the game and found that CoG still have't fixed missing achievements for those who was playing before achievements system was introduced (except of the some castle/dungeon/hero achievements, it was fixed, thanks).

I would like to ask CoG support staff to fix those missed 36 achievements of my character.
